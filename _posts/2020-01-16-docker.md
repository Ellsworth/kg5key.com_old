# An update on my work on this website

When I initially spun up this *DigitalOcean* VPS, I just installed the software I needed via `apt`. As my needs grew, the list of software I used grew just as fast. This quickly became a mess as I tried to managed software I forgot I had installed.

Dependencies grew, and of course I ran into the typical limbo of managing conflicting software. *Yikes*

### Dockerize Everything
Naturally, I began the slow process of using [Docker](https://docker.io) to simplify software installs and dependencies. Docker containerizes software, preventing the need to manage dependencies and helps eliminate the *But it worked on my machine!1!!* excuse.

### What got Dockerized?
So far the list is ever pending. Once I got the Dockerized versions of the software working on the new droplet to an acceptable extent, I nuked the old VPS.

* Grafana (Dashboard)
* InfluxDB (Database)
* Red-DiscordBot (Discord bot, mainly for fun.)
* Transmission (Bittorrent)
* Jekyll (Takes the markdown files and turns them into this poorly maintained blog.)

At the moment, `nginx` is not Dockerized. I have no idea how to setup reverse proxy while `nginx` is dockerized.
